Logre is a simple and intuitive open source graph editor that runs locally.

The idea behind this tool is to give a simple GUI for graph users.

- `make` (native on MacOS and Linux, for Windows users, install it with `winget install ezwinports.make`).
- Python3.10 or newer; **May** also work with older version.

### Install

- Open a Terminal, and change directory to the place where you want to have your tool
- Run `git clone https://github.com/geovistory/logre.git`
- Run `cd logre`
- Run `make install` (optional, when starting the tool, install is run anyways)

### Start

- In your folder, simply run `make start`, this will update the dependencies, and start the GUI

### Update

- In your folder, simply run `make update`

## Development

Logre is developed iteratively, one small feature at a time.
